I have an scenario in which childe files have wrong filepath while it's parent file which folder and nodetype is 1 have correct filepath I want to check all files have incorrect filepath in table qmsdtlsfile_log and nodetype is 0 which is for file extra those file but make sure 
e.g folder path is DOCUMENTS/(00_Tariq while filepath is DOCUMENTS/(00_Tariq/QMS_4ec95f41-4043-4bc2-a20a-36d5e8f3018b.txt and firstly remove file encrypted name and then compare if folder and file path is not same give that file
