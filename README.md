write purpose and scope for technical document while our approach is 

"We have decided to create a list to track the execution of functions. Each executed function will be added to this list for monitoring purposes. If session kill or deadlock occurs during the process, We will retry three times to determine if the deadlock has been resolved. During each retry, we will check the list to see which steps have been completed and continue execution from where it left off. If the deadlock persist even after the third try, we will stop processing. We will also improve the Send RFQ backend code to enhance execution performance.
Additionally, when sending RFQs, we have improved logging across all stored procedures involved, adding steps for better traceability. In case of transaction rollback due to an error, detailed information about the step at which the error occurred is saved in the database (inf_log table). This will allow us to identify the exact step in the stored procedure where an issue occurred if any problems arise in the future. "
